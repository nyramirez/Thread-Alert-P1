FE = Future Enhancement – something we may include if we have time, or could add later.

Picture
•	Check that Nestor (an example) is who he says he is.  This would be far easier if we had Nestor sign in and then checked his photo against a stored version, rather than going through a raft of people to find out who he is (which would be an FE).
•	Look at his emotions.  Compare with previous values (Roger).
•	Responsibility: Akanksha (but Roger will do the Firebase stuff)

Questionnaire
•	Responsibility: Aimé

User Interface
•	Responsibility: Nestor

Database
•	Responsibility: Roger

Government database
•	For crime rate
•	Responsibility: Roger
    Done.  Well, kind of.  By a downloaded and much edited spreadsheet.  Loaded in to Firebase through readjson.js, which is run by node (node readjson.js).  It won't run in a browser.
